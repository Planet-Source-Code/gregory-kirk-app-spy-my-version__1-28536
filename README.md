### Description

This is a combination of three programs found here on PSC. It enumerates active programs and their windows. I left in the original Startup programs list. I did add a few extras of my own, although, it is mostly based upon App Spy by some bloke. The orginal App Spy was here last month but not any more so I do not know who to give credit to...
 
### More Info
 
Tested on W98 only, so bug off if you can not get it to run on NT or 2K.
